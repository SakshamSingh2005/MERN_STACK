For years he chased glory with his country, for years he was compared, doubted, questioned… but tonight, he is immortal. He has done it, he has lifted his nation to the summit of Europe!

The tears of pain have turned into tears of joy. Cristiano Ronaldo — European champion at last!"*</i></article>
