            <article><i>*"History in Paris! Portugal — against all odds, against every setback — are the champions of Europe!
Cristiano Ronaldo, the captain, the talisman, the man who was carried off in tears in the first half, now returns to the touchline in triumph, celebrating with his teammates!

Éder, the unlikely hero, with that thunderbolt in extra time, but this moment… this moment belongs to Portugal, and to Ronaldo!

For years he chased glory with his country, for years he was compared, doubted, questioned… but tonight, he is immortal. He has done it, he has lifted his nation to the summit of Europe!

The tears of pain have turned into tears of joy. Cristiano Ronaldo — European champion at last!"*</i></article>
